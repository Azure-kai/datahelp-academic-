# datahelp-academic-
This is a project built for my personal academic processing of some dataset. The functions in this project are some common methods I always have to use to clean or modify the data, such as CAR(a model to measure the short return of a listed company). It is convenient to do the same things in the future by coding these methods and combining them together.
